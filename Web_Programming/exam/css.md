- CSS was added to HTML to **separate content (HTML)** from **presentation (CSS)**.
- Allows site-wide changes by editing a single file.
- Usually stored in `.css` files, but can be internal or inline:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## 📝 Why CSS?

- HTML is for structure; CSS is for **styling**.

- CSS keeps style info separate, making web design easier:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
